            <p className="text-lg mb-4">Hey everyone,</p>
            <p className="mb-3">This isn't an easy post to write, but after a lot of thought, I've decided to <strong>suspend development on ZalcBot until further notice</strong>.</p>
            <p className="mb-3">Over the past year, building and refining ZalcBot has been an incredible journey. Seeing the community grow, watching people use the bot in ways I never imagined, and getting to work on something I'm truly passionate about has been an amazing experience. But somewhere along the way, I lost balance.</p>
            <p className="mb-3">Lately, I've been feeling the effects of being <em>too online</em>â€”constantly plugged in, always working on something, and rarely giving myself the space to just <em>live</em>. It's taken a toll on me, and I need to step back to focus on my life outside the screen.</p>
            <p className="mb-3">This isn't goodbye forever, but right now, I need to prioritize my well-being. Thank you to <strong>everyone</strong> who has supported ZalcBotâ€”whether you've used it, given feedback, or just been part of the journey. I appreciate you all more than you know.</p>
            <p className="mb-3">For now, ZalcBot will remain offline, but I can work with any of you for a new course of action.</p>
